        <h2>About Me</h2> 
        
        <img src="images/birthday pic.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
    I was born at the end of the summer of 1977. I have an older sibling that is 5 years older then me in age. I was born in Philadelphia Pa, and resided in the locatio
for most of my adult life. I attended several types of educational schooling inclduning elementry school at O.M.C and high school at Martin Luther King H.S.. 
I completed my undergrand studies in Special Education k-12 and my gradute studies in Education Leadership. I have extensive experience in the behavioral 
health field and worked as a mental health profession for the past 14 years.
I currently have interest in becoming a web developer and decided to attend George Washington's Boot Cmp Coding program to become a full stack developer.
This is a new area of study to me, but I have a lot of interest in technology and the building of social platforms to improve our community.</p>
